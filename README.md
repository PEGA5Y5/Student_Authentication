# Student_Authentication

Hi guys :blush:, this my sem mini project Student_Authentication system. 
I have used html,css code as front-end & php as server-side language and additional mysql database to store the student informations.
i also used Animated.css & Hover.css libraries to make the webpage more attractive & beautiful.
